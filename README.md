# Day-Organizer
This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
I utilized the moment.js library to work with time attributes throughout the planner.
Also I used local storage to keep saved appointments or anything in the textareas, so you can refer back to them until you clear.
